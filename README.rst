Introduction
============

Cloud Inquisitor can be used to improve the security posture of your AWS footprint through:

* monitoring AWS objects for ownership attribution, notifying account owners of unowned objects, and subsequently removing unowned AWS objects if ownership is not resolved.
* detecting `domain hijacking <https://labs.detectify.com/2014/10/21/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-herokugithubdesk-more/>`_.
* verifying security services such as `Cloudtrail <https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/>`_ and `VPC Flowlogs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html>`_.
* managing `IAM policies <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html>`_ across multiple accounts.

Please see the official docs `here <https://cloud-inquisitor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information on how to deploy, configure and operate Cloud Inquisitor in your environment.
